# visual odometry
it's part of self-driving stack still under development, visual odometry extract depth map, odometry, enhance detection, localization certainty, and lane keeping with aid of semantic segmentation.


# depth vision, and lane keeping
extract vertical lines, keep those detected as lanes, filter the current lane area, estimate distance to object from stereo.
